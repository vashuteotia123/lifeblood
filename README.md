LEGAL FORM OF OWNER SHIP:
PARTNERSHIP:
A partnership is a business union in which two or more individuals manage and maintain their business. Unlike a corporation or LLC, a partnership requires no incorporation paperwork with the Federal government. Therefore, the three types of partnerships – general, limited or limited liability – are somewhat informal structures.
In a General Partnership, all owners (or general partners (GPs) are equally responsible for the debts of the business, each assuming unlimited liability.

THE PROS	THE CONS
Flow-through income taxation for all partners	Each owner is equally responsible for debt and loss
Less expensive and less paperwork than incorporating or filing to become an LLC	Creditors can go after your personal property to satisfy a claim if your business assets aren’t enough
Partners can pool resources and share the financial obligation rather than facing it alone	Liable for debts and actions of your partner
No rigid, obligatory corporate structure	Limited capacity to raise money and attract investors

We have choose this because all profits and debts can equally distributed among us so we can run our business without any misunderstandings among us.

Products and Services:

We don’t charge anything for information except the transport charges in case if the transport is provided by us. In case any delay occur our staff come contact with customer via call.

MARKETING PLAN
Our company is based on blood donation, where we take the details of the donors and give it to the recipient and our market is based on the people who donates their blood. Our company is limited up to Indian users 
Based on our research we have found out that in India more than 5 lakhs plus accident cases which has been recorded on 2019, where more than 1.5 lakhs died and 4.5 lakhs have been injured. In India we have nearly 11 million active donors which is 0.008 percent of total India’s population. And in India nearly 9 million units of blood is required every year but India is able to collect only 4.4 million units of blood annually. 
We have a huge market in India where people are need to be given awareness and the positive side of blood donation. And in our company nearly 40% shares are hold by the shareholders. Our targeted markets are the emergency and critical cases, that to in India accident cases are getting high day by day also the emergency cases so trends for our market is always high.
While entering the market our company would face some typical barriers like: same/similar type of companies (NGO, other blood bank centers), high marketing costs, consumer acceptance, brand recognition, training new employees, shipping cost.
We would overcome these barriers by offering some special and unique offers to our customers, and we would use social media as our platform for advertisements. Changing in technology or changing in government regulations won’t affect our company because it’s purely dependent on people who donate their blood
PRODUCT
Benefits and features of our product:
More specially our product is an app where we will collect the details of donors and the Medical certificate of the donor and the details of the donor is sorted out city wise and these data are shown to the recipient who is using this app.
Major feature of our product:
Donor's details are collected and shown in city wise, Even the recipient details are collected and the required data is shown to the recipient, After the recipient places his order via hospital the transportation of the blood from the donor to recipient is done for free of cost.
CUSTOMERS
People form an age of 18-65 are capable for donating their blood. Indiscrete of gender, location and education anyone can donate blood. Except people who are suffering from any chronical diseases. In India only 0.008% of donors are active so it's necessary for people to get enough awareness and positive effects of blood donation.

•	Indian Red Cross Society.

Promotional Budget
As of now we are planning to pay around 1,000,000 for promotional things including all platforms and way of promotion. And a great advantage we got is that collaborating with NGOs help us in creating awareness about blood donation as well as our platform for user to get help any time they want. So, it seems to be a great source for promotion and marketing of our app.
We are planning to divide our budget into two categories:
Before start-up which will get a budget around 3,00,000 and the main source of it will be through social media. 
During the course of start-up which will get a budget of 7,00,00 as initial and the main source of it will be through events organising at NGOs and hospitals for creating awareness all around the country.
Pricing
Our pricing technique is too simple as we will be deducting 10% of fee in between the client and the donor. A transaction interface will be shown to the user where all the charges will be displayed to the user before making any deal with the donor. So, it will be a great opportunity for to gain trust of user and get a niche control over the market.
Talking about comparing the price, as being the first one in the market we need not to worry about the competition in the market and need no to worry about the pricing.
Service will be provided to the customer on non-credit payment mode where user have to pay as soon as he receives the blood and get its verification done by the respective hospital. Donor or the hospital need not to worry about the money, as they will get it into their bank account as soon as we get paid by the client or user asked for the blood.
Proposed location
Our start-up is not location specific as all the business is carried out over internet and the user never has to visit our office in person so we can start it anywhere we want keeping the needs of internet connectivity and server room space in mind.
Distribution channel 
We have different mode to circulate our app:
A user can download it from playstore, app store, or Microsoft store.
OR
A user can simply visit our website to avail the service by logging in into the site.
For organisations and hospitals, we have different section where we keep the blood supply in our priority list to maintain the trust of them into our business.
Sales Forecast
We will be measuring Sales forecast by two means:
1.	Short term forecasting 
2.	Long term forecasting 
Short term forecasting 
It will include mainly the customer base we have to make to get established in the market. And for that we will have to maintain the trust of our company by reducing the cost our product and it will not last for more than 3-4 years of our startup.
Our main goal in this will be to set the sales goal and accomplish it by the end of that particular period.
Long term forecasting 
 It will include all kind of improvements and add ins that will be required by our product and have to be made in that period of our business.

Operational Plans
Production:
Our team of web and app developers will continuously keep working on developing app with zero negligence to error and bugs. 
For developing app we will require people with different fields or knowledge Swift, Kotlin, Java and Dart programming language to build app for various operating systems consist of Android, Windows and iOS. Similarly goes for webapp development. Main framework in work is Django as of now front-ended by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
All database will be handled through MySQL and PostgreSQL. Including database provided by different hospitals and blood banks around the country. 
Quality check of service will be taken care as priority as of matter of life. We really need to depend on more than two servers to provide continuous service to patients and donors. If any problem exists in between patient and client on going conversation the app will directly switch to another server or provide contact info to user with the help of SMS depending upon which blood group the user last searched for when app through the glitch.
Production cost includes server cost and cost for version-control.
Location:
Any kind of office in Co-operate building will satisfy our need and it will be very beneficial to locate near any engineering college as a lot students would love to be intern for something like this. As will help them to grow them in their technical field and give exposure to field knowledge.
Allowing 120 square ft for each employ and including space required for server room it will be nearly around 10000 sq. ft. 
Power supply is one of our top priority in this as no long power cut should happen as it may lead to shutdown of servers and may risk someone’s life. So, the power will work on UPS system and the power cut will not be a problem for server strength fluctuation. 
As our business doesn’t require any kind of transportation and client’s way to our offices, we would be saving lots of resources through it. Parking facility will only be required for staff members. 
Office layout will be as simple as of any working office, we got rough idea of it:
 
We can’t categories our working schedule as it needs to be in running whole day and night. So, taking it into consideration we have 3 shifts for our staff which looks something like this:
9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.
5:00 p.m. – 1 a.m.
1:00 a.m. – 9:00 a.m.

Legal Environment 
We will need to receive licencing from the govt. of India and a legal verification from High Court to make bonding with NGOs, blood bank and hospitals for getting their database into our system. 
Health of our employees needs to be taken care of so we allow them to for 5 days a week and creating shift for people on weekends taking our business into consideration. Every system that have access to our database need ID and Password for verifying employ identity and mapping every action of user so that employ can’t make any changes to existing database and cause any loss to our business. Keep rules and regulations for employ to be very specific to maintain the discipline in business environment. We can’t allow and employ with history of drug abuse and criminal charges into our company. As it may cause severe damage to our old employee’s health and mindset.
Insurance coverage will be there for staff as well as company to overcome if any damage happens to individual or the company.
Patent is pending right now but it will be done as soon as we come to the part of start-up and verifying every aspect of our idea.

Personnel
Looking over our all requirements and shifts we will require around 43 employees so far, which includes 25 developers, 5 people in managing team,3 people in accounting team and 10 people for market search. We can find all our requirements while looking into engineering and management colleges. All staff needs to be expert or master in their respective field.

Credit and policy are as follow:
Suppliers will be paid in accordance of blood exchange held by different hospitals. The amount will be credited from one hospital to another with 10% our fee in it. 
Our suppliers can also be the server providers and the internet providers as a large amount of database exchange take place every working day of our business. 
Looking from our side hospitals will be reliable on us and we would love to provide the service from our side with no personal dispute between us.
Yes, we expect shortage of supply as we would have full access to hospital database and only short may occur if the strength of donor decreases with any kind of pandemic like COVID19 and the demand increases exponentially. But we will try our best to provide with maximum demand we can fulfil.

Credit Policies
We will receive our fee when the patient gets the blood fully verified. The cost the patient pays to the hospital from where he got the blood will gets deducted with 10% from our side.
The creditworthiness depends upon the hospital requesting for blood not the patient. So, it will be much easier to build up the trust on hospitals as it is an organization instead of an individual.
 The credit needs to be prompt one once the hospital gets the blood verifies it. So, there is no need to maintain records for amount receivable and amount payable.

Management and Organisation
The business will be managed by the CEO of the company. If by any chance the CEO is not able to able at the situation where a decision is needed to be made. The Manager will take the call after consulting with CEO over phone.

Start up Expenses and Capitalization
TO start up our business successfully without any financial debt we are trying to take a loan before starting up business, even before starting a business we need to spend some money for hospital managements and blood banks for collecting information and to include in  our app we need to spend salary for app developers and coders, Should pay for the furniture data base set up some interiors and for the place. Even after the business is established it takes some time to built a trust and to get profits. So we are putting a 25% of capital for depts that we are facing in our initial period.
We can apply loan in banks and some investments from NGOS banks may not get any share value in our company but the NGOs can get the share in according to the percentage of investment. NGOs can get a maximum of 20% shares we are not accepting more to invest on our product.
We are applying for loan on the brand value of the company if we are not able to repay it back, we can sell our shares or handover our business to the bank. But for increasing a profit we are planning  to conduct awareness programmes and those who are participating in those will get a exciting prizes.

FINANCIAL PLAN:
12-Month Profit and Loss Projection
•	Our profits are directly collected from the hospitals or by the app user directly
•	Each rupee of amount is counted and stored in our data base so at the end of the year we can calculate what we have spent and how much we get it back. If the profit is not as what we estimated we can arrange for board meetings and can think further to do what for increasing our share value and profits.
•	Should introduce subsidies based on the government proof cards like white cards, ration cards etc these proofs can be submitted directly to hospitals through the app without going to hospital .so that he can save a time for treatment like these we will provide extra features to make ourselves stronger and to get rid from losses.
•	Here below is the sample table which we are going to follow in our business.
•	 
Refining the plan:
PROJECTED CASH FLOW
Now as we have built the monthly balance sheet, we can build the monthly cash flow projections:
•	Cash Flow from Operation includes the change in Net Working Capital which is due to the change in receivables, payables and other net working capital items
•	Cash Flow from Investing to include capital expenditures (CAPEX) and software development costs (in this example assumed to be activated on the Balance Sheet and amortized over time)
•	Cash Flow from Financing also allows to run a scenario where some form of debt financing can be used

 
Projection of Monthly Balance Sheet
We now even go as far to project a monthly balance sheet. The reason is simply that we want to have consistency between our monthly and yearly financial projections to make the app financial model better readable.
•	Net Working Capital items such as receivables, payables etc. are estimated based on the days outstanding and dividing by 12
•	Fixed Assets are estimated by adding the monthly capital expenditures (assumed to occur in the first month of the year) and by deducting the monthly depreciation expenses
•	Dito for software development expenses and their amortization expenses
•	Initial equity is calculated based on the required funding amount to cover all costs (the minimum of cumulated Free Cash Flows to Firm during our financial projections)
•	The Balance Sheet allows to track and compare the monthly cash balance so that we ensure there is sufficient money raised

 
Projection of EBITDA Breakeven and Payback Period
We now simply add a function to figure out in which month EBITDA becomes positive to calculate the breakeven point of EBITDA.
To calculate the payback period, we calculate first Free Cash Flows to Firm (FCFF) and add a function to track in which month the cumulative Free Cash Flows become positive again, meaning by when the investment is paid back. This allows investors to compare the project with other investment project.
 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
For every living thing on this earth life is more important than anything else. Even the proper treatment sophisticated machines are available we are failing to save lives, because of the emergency of availability of required blood group for treatment. Accidents are happening in our everyday life in these, major are head injuries. This Treatment requires badly the blood for giving a treatment. With our “LIFE BLOOD” one can know the availability of respective group in their surrounding blood banks.
Our product gives the information by sharing the location of blood bank and the health sheet of the donor. The condition of blood is tested once again before giving to customer. The Customers are the relatives or friends of the patients. Since life is most important thing and even the blood is available due to lack of information the helping work of donors become useless. We should make our best to make it useful.
Awareness on blood donating should be created by sharing the relevant information through our app or by making calls directly to the customers.
To setup our start up business we may require approximate amount of 4 crores these includes the salaries for app developers, technical staffs, rent for place, Data base setup, Computers, furniture, transport, cost of database from hospitals and advertisements.
